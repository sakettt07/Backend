# Backend
Day-1 ✅
Starting off with some new Tech stacks i have started learning backend developement.
In the above files i have written my first Node.js and Express.js code for getting handy in the backend.
Learned about how to use npm and use its packages 
1.Otp generator
2.Figlet Art
3.One Liner Joke
In Express I have learned about Routing parameter , Template Engine, what is Ejs(i can say it is a exact copy of the html),Powers of Ejs,About Static files how to setup them in the ejs fles.
Learned about the error handling in Ejs.

Day-2 ✅
Learned about how to setup up an app using the express generator.
Express generator is a helper tool for the backend developer so that he/she dont have to make the express files from the scratch.
TO setup the express generator following are the steps
1.npm i express-generator -g
2.cd desktop
3.express appname --view=ejs
4.cd appname
5.npm i

Your App is ready 👍😎

The changes that occurs due to express generator is you have to use router.get instead of app.get
in the previous method you have to use npx nodemon [filename] to run the server for the specific file now you only have to run npx nodemon .

Day-3 ✅
